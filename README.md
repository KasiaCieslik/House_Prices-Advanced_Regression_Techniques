# House_Prices-Advanced_Regression_Techniques
>>Note: This is **work-in-progress**. Project which I do during a Frauenloop Machine Learning Bootcamp in winter 2021.

Repository for source code of kaggle competition: 
[House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
### Overview
The main goal of the project is to predict the **Sale Price** using regression techniques. 
To solve the competition I did following steps:
- data exploration
- data preprocessing and feature enginnering
- algorithm selection for regression

I wrote 'flexible' pipeline to have possibility to f.exp. activate analyse with extra features. 

From Kaggle:
*Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence. With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.*
